# MANGA WEBSITE

 Manga Website 
A webste i made because I enjoy reading manga


__Motivation__

I enjoy reading manga so I felt that making a project relating tom something I enjoy doing/reading would keep me motivated.

__How to use__

__-1__)You can click on any of the images on the front page to be brought to the next page which displays the manga information for that clicked image. You may also use the search bar at the top of the page to search for a manga. Upon clicking the image of the search result you will then be brought to the page with that manga's information.

__-2__)The manga information page shows the available chapters for the manga you have selected. As well as a short synopsis. Please take note that at this time the genre's for each manga are not dynamically set and each one currently has the same value.

__-3__)Select either the first/last chapter which is shown in large on the manga's information page. Otherwise, you cam select any chapter from the list under the manga information. Clicking on a chapter will load that chapters pages and bring you to another page to view it.

__-4__)Once on one of the chapter pages you are now able to read through the chapter of your selected manga. If you wish to change chapter you can use the chapter lis at the top left of the page to move to another chapter. You could also use the next/ prev buttons to change chapter. The latter only currently works once and requires fixing.

__-5__)You can leave a comment at the end of the chapter if you wish to do so. This may change in future to require you to sign in to be able to leave a comment.

__-6__)Sign in functionality has not been implemented yet.

__-7__)Bookmark functionality has not been implemented as of yet.

__Challenges__

There are currently some issues that require more work for me to be satisfied with the site. Please see below:

--Next & Previous buttons only working once.
--Recommendations buttons to change the data 
--Default values need to be assigned to manga information so that if data has not loaded yet the user does not see moving elements becasuse a lack of used space
--Comment section could be more visually appealing and could use profile pictures of signed in users.
